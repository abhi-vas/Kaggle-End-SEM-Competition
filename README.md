About Project:
This project focuses on building a metric-learning model for a Kaggle competition that evaluates how well a model can understand and compare prompt–response pairs. The work involved transforming raw text into embeddings, cleaning and vectorizing them to create a stable feature space. Using these processed representations, the model was trained to learn meaningful similarities between prompts and responses. The final system demonstrated strong performance on the test data, showing its ability to generalize beyond the training set. Overall, the project showcases a complete and effective workflow for solving a real-world metric-learning challenge.
